# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions

This repository contains solutions for the Advent of Code 2023 programming challenges, implemented in Rust. Each day's solution is organized in its own directory with separate implementations for both parts of the daily challenge.

## Project Structure

```
├── day1/
├── day2/
├── day3/
├── day4/
├── day5/
├── day6/
├── day7/
├── day8/
├── day9/
├── day10/
├── day11/
└── day12/
```

Each day's directory contains:
- `src/main.rs`: Solution implementation
- `input.txt`: Challenge input data

## Prerequisites

- Rust (latest stable version)
- Cargo (Rust's package manager)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aoc-2023.git
cd aoc-2023
```

2. Run a specific day's solution:
```bash
cd day1
cargo run
```

## Solutions Overview

- **Day 1**: Text processing and number extraction
- **Day 2**: Game simulation and constraint validation
- **Day 3**: Grid processing and number scanning
- **Day 4**: Card game scoring system
- **Day 5**: Range mapping and optimization
- **Day 6**: Race timing calculations
- **Day 7**: Card hand classification and ranking
- **Day 8**: Graph traversal and path finding
- **Day 9**: Sequence prediction and extrapolation
- **Day 10**: Pipe maze navigation and enclosed area calculation
- **Day 11**: Galaxy expansion and distance calculation
- **Day 12**: Dynamic programming with pattern matching

## Implementation Details

Each day's solution is implemented with performance and readability in mind. Solutions typically include:
- Part 1 and Part 2 implementations
- Helper functions for specific calculations
- Efficient data structures for optimal performance
- Comments explaining complex logic

## Running Tests

While formal tests aren't included, each solution can be verified against the example inputs provided in the daily challenges.
