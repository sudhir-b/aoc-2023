# Advent of Code 2023

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenges, implemented in Rust. Each day's solution is organized as a separate package within a Rust workspace.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as a Rust workspace with individual crates for each day's challenge:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml
â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.lock
â”œâ”€â”€ day1/
â”œâ”€â”€ day2/
â”œâ”€â”€ day3/
â”œâ”€â”€ day4/
â”œâ”€â”€ day5/
â”œâ”€â”€ day6/
â”œâ”€â”€ day7/
â”œâ”€â”€ day8/
â”œâ”€â”€ day9/
â”œâ”€â”€ day10/
â”œâ”€â”€ day11/
â””â”€â”€ day12/
```

Each day's directory contains its own `Cargo.toml` and source code in the `src` directory.

## Prerequisites

- Rust (latest stable version)
- Cargo (comes with Rust)

You can install Rust using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/):

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

## Building the Project

To build all solutions:

```bash
cargo build
```

To build a specific day's solution (e.g., day 1):

```bash
cargo build -p day1
```

## Running the Solutions

To run a specific day's solution:

```bash
cargo run -p day<N>
```

Replace `<N>` with the day number (1-12).

For example, to run day 1's solution:

```bash
cargo run -p day1
```

## Tests

To run tests for all solutions:

```bash
cargo test
```

To run tests for a specific day:

```bash
cargo test -p day<N>
```

## Project Structure Details

Each day's solution is structured as follows:

```
day<N>/
â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml
â””â”€â”€ src/
    â”œâ”€â”€ main.rs
    â””â”€â”€ lib.rs (if applicable)
```
